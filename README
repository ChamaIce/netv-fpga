Verilog code for the NeTV FPGA.

Please pay attention to the version number embedded inside hdmi_overlay.v. This, along with the version notes, will inform you as to the latest status of the code.

The code as checked-in is structured according to how the Xilinx ISE tools placed my code when using the PlanAhead flow. 

This was most recently compiled using ISE Design Suite 13.3 (as of May 2012).
